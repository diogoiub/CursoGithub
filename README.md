### System Information
Windows 10** is a series of [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) developed by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and released as part of its [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT) family of operating systems. It is the successor to [Windows 8.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8.1), released nearly two years earlier, and was [released to manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_cycle#Release_to_manufacturing_(RTM)) on July 15, 2015, and broadly released for the general public on July 29, 2015.[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#cite_note-release-date-18) Windows 10 was made available for download via [MSDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSDN) and [Technet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Technet), and as a free upgrade for retail copies of [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8) and [Windows RT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT) users via the [Windows Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store). Windows 10 receives new [builds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build) on an ongoing basis, which are available at no additional cost to users, in addition to additional test builds of Windows 10, which are available to [Windows Insiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Insider). Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that only receive critical updates, such as security [patches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)), over their ten-year lifespan of extended support.

Windows 10 supports [universal apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_app), an expansion of the [Metro-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-style_app) first introduced in [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8). Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code‍—‌including [PCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer), [tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer), [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone), [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system), [Xbox One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One), [Surface Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Hub) and [Mixed Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mixed_Reality). The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a [touchscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen)-optimized interface based on available input devices‍—‌particularly on [2-in-1 PCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC), both interfaces include an updated [Start menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu) which incorporates elements of [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7)'s traditional Start menu with the tiles of [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8). Windows 10 also introduced the [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge) [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), a [virtual desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop) system, a window and desktop management feature called [Task View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_View), support for [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition) and [face recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_recognition) login, new security features for enterprise environments, and [DirectX 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX_12).

Windows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of Windows 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of its predecessor. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, [Xbox Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live) integration, as well as the functionality and capabilities of the [Cortana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana) personal assistant and the replacement of [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) with Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of the changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory [update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update) installation, [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_privacy) concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and [adware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adware)-esque tactics used to promote the operating system on its release
